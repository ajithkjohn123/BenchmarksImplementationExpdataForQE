This folder contains the non-proprietary VHDL designs 
we have experimented with. 

Content of each folder
-------------------------

Each folder contains an input vhdl design, a property 
file named property_bpsl.txt, a file named 
outputs-signals.txt, some rule files, and (in some cases)
a file named signals.txt. 

property_bpsl.txt: This file contains the property in 
bounded PSL. 

outputs-signals.txt : This is the set of output signals 
that the property is interested in.

signals.txt : Specifies the internal signals which should 
not be existentially quantified out while generating the 
abstract transition relation. By default, all internal 
signals are existentially quantified out for generating the 
abstract transition relation.
